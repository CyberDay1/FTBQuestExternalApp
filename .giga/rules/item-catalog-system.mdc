# item-catalog-system

### Core Components

1. **Catalog Extraction System (85)**
The ItemCatalogExtractor provides a specialized workflow for pulling item data from Minecraft JAR files:

- Handles both vanilla and modded item extraction
- Processes JSON assets and resources to build normalized item metadata 
- Maps texture references to items and caches associated resources
- Merges multiple catalogs while preserving unique items and metadata

Key files:
```
ingestion/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/ingest/ItemCatalogExtractor.java
ingestion/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/ingest/ItemCatalog.java
```

2. **Version Management (80)** 
The VersionCatalog system maintains version-specific item data:

- Tracks available items per Minecraft version
- Manages active version selection and catalog switching
- Merges vanilla and mod-specific catalogs
- Validates version compatibility of items

Key files:
```
core-domain/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/domain/version/VersionCatalog.java
services/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/services/version/VersionCatalogImpl.java
```

3. **Item Reference System (75)**
Specialized reference tracking and validation:

- Maps item IDs across different versions and mods
- Validates item existence and compatibility
- Maintains metadata linkages between items and their resources
- Handles tag-based item references

Key files:
```
io-formats/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/io/model/ItemRefData.java
core-domain/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/domain/ItemRef.java
```

4. **Resource Management (70)**
The IconCache and resource ID system:

- Manages texture and icon resources for items
- Caches frequently accessed resources
- Validates resource existence and accessibility
- Maps resources across versions

Key files:
```
ingestion/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/ingest/IconCache.java
core-domain/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/resources/ResourceId.java
```
