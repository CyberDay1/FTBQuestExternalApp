# validation-framework

The validation framework consists of three key validators for ensuring quest data integrity:

## BrokenReferenceValidator (Importance Score: 85)
`core-domain/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/validation/BrokenReferenceValidator.java`

Validates references between quest components to ensure data consistency. Implements the Validator interface to detect broken links between:
- Quest dependencies
- Item references
- Icon references
- Background references
- Tag references

## LootWeightsValidator (Importance Score: 75)  
`core-domain/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/validation/LootWeightsValidator.java`

Validates the loot table weight configurations to ensure proper probability distributions:
- Verifies loot pool weight totals
- Checks individual entry weight values
- Validates conditional weight modifiers
- Ensures weight values are within valid ranges

## RequiredFieldsValidator (Importance Score: 80)
`core-domain/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/validation/RequiredFieldsValidator.java`

Enforces required field constraints across quest data models:
- Chapter required fields validation
- Quest required fields validation 
- Reward required fields validation
- Task required fields validation
- LootTable required fields validation

## ValidationIssue Management (Importance Score: 70)
`core-domain/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/validation/ValidationIssue.java`

Represents validation failures with:
- Issue severity levels
- Affected component references
- Validation rule identifiers
- Detailed error messages

The framework integrates with the core domain models to provide validation during quest file operations and modifications.
