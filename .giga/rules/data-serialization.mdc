# data-serialization

### Core JSON Serialization Components (Importance Score: 85)
- **File Path:** `io-formats/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/io/JsonConfig.java`

The JSON serialization system handles specialized quest and loot table data formats through:

1. Custom ObjectMapper configurations for quest-specific JSON structures
2. Domain-specific serialization rules for quest dependencies and reward chains
3. Polymorphic deserialization handlers for different task and reward types
4. Version-aware parsing to maintain backward compatibility with older quest formats

### Quest File Format Processing (Importance Score: 90) 
- **File Path:** `io-formats/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/io/QuestFileJson.java`

Specialized quest file processing includes:

1. Chapter hierarchy serialization with nested group structures
2. Quest dependency graph serialization maintaining referential integrity
3. Custom task type registration and polymorphic deserialization
4. Background and icon reference resolution during deserialization

### Loot Table Serialization (Importance Score: 75)
- **File Path:** `io-formats/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/io/LootTableJson.java`

The loot table serialization system handles:

1. Pool-based loot structure serialization
2. Condition and function chain processing
3. Weight-based entry serialization
4. NBT data preservation for complex item stacks

### Import/Export Workflows (Importance Score: 70)
- **File Path:**
  - `io-formats/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/io/exporter/Exporter.java`
  - `io-formats/src/main/java/dev/ftbq/editor/io/importer/Importer.java`

Specialized data transformation workflows for:

1. Quest pack format conversion between versions
2. Loot table migration and upgrade paths
3. Reference resolution during import/export operations
4. Validation of structural integrity during transformations
