# FTBQuestExternalApp (Java Port)

This repository is currently a stub for the Java port of the FTB Quest External App.

## Current Status

The codebase has not been populated yet. Use this repository as the starting point for
future Codex tasks or manual development work.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a working branch for your changes.
3. Implement the desired functionality.
4. Commit your work with messages that follow the `<task id>: <summary>` convention.

## Conventions

- Do not commit binary artifacts (for example, PNG images, JAR files, or compiled
  outputs).
- Keep the project headless; do not run any GUI clients as part of the workflow.
- Prefer source files, JSON, and other text-based assets in version control.

## Notes

If you encounter missing instructions or tasks, document your observations in the
repository so future contributors can pick up where you left off.
